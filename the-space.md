## 46 Essex St., Guelph Ontario

We are pleased to have a little space to call our own in Guelph.  Silence (the space) opened its doors to the public for the first time to welcome the Convergence Ensemble on the 24th February 2013 - what a great first concert!  

We’ve recently completed major renovations to the space - it’s now bigger, better, wheelchair accessible, with better power, lights... 

What is it?  It’s a mostly open room of about 920 square feet (seated capacity ~55, standing ~90), 10-12’ ceilings, white walls suitable for projections or artwork, a counter/bar where home-roasted espresso is prepared.  It’s a space suitable for concerts, workshops, meetings, rehearsals, film screenings, installation art, improvisation sessions...

Interested?  Come to one of our shows, drop in to one of our [events][events], or [email us][email].  Silence is available for rentals at the following rates:

> Please note that our rental rates are currently under review.  Please [contact us][email] for details if you’d like to rent the space for your event.

Please contact us for corporate and institutional rates.

A lot of work went into getting it ready, with a lot of help from some great people.  Special thanks to Colin Couch, Daniel Fischlin, Michael Kosir, Henry Muth, Gary Diggins, Tom Wolf, Jason Maraschiello, Gord Auld, Dan Beeson, Cathy Cripps, Rick Kowalczykowski, Eden Segal-Grossman, Doug Horne, Lynette Segal, Val Morse, Isabel Segal-Grossman (and probably others I’ve overlooked, sorry!).  Spiritual guidance by Joe Sorbara, Scott Thomson, Ron Gaskin, Daniel Fischlin, Peter Bradley and everyone who’s come out to shows or said “what a cool idea”.  Thank you!

<span class='small dark-grey'>please note that while we do have rent and bills to pay and welcome cash at these rates, we are committed to making this space accessible, especially for innovative, experimental projects.  and we’re happy to find ways to avoid using our centralized currency wherever possible - if these rates are hard to manage, let’s talk.</span>
